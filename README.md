# catan-simple

## Purpose
Made for Settlers of Catan (board game) play during social distancing. A group of people can set up a virtual game with cameras and Skype, but didn't have a good solution for dealing with the deck of development cards. Ideally, no one could see anyone else's selection, and cards being removed should be reflected in every user's deck.

## Use
Users all draw cards from the same deck, and all connected devices are updated live to show that a card has been drawn. Users are also able to roll dice, which is also updated live on every device.

The application supports multiple groups of people playing at the same time.
